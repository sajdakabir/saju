# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing personal portfolio landing page by adding a single "see my notes" text line while keeping all existing content exactly as it is. When clicked, this text will reveal a navigation bar with three main sections: projects, notes, and photos. The landing page design and layout should remain unchanged except for this one additional interactive element.

## Requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to navigate between different sections (projects, notes, photos), so that I can explore different types of content on the portfolio.
