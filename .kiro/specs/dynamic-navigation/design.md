# Design Document

## Overview

This feature will add a single "see my notes" text line to the existing landing page that, when clicked, reveals a navigation bar with three sections: projects, notes, and photos. The design maintains the current minimalist aesthetic and dark/light theme support while adding smooth interactions.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
- **Main Landing Page Component** (`src/app/page.tsx`): Enhanced with navigation state management
- **Navigation Component**: New reusable component for the dynamic navigation bar
- **State Management**: React useState for navigation visibility toggle
- **Routing**: Utilize Next.js App Router for navigation between sections

### Key Design Principles
1. **Preserve Existing Design**: Keep all current styling, layout, and functionality intact
2. **Minimal Addition**: Add only the "see my notes" text and navigation functionality
3. **Consistent Theming**: Maintain dark/light theme support throughout
4. **Smooth Interactions**: Use CSS transitions for polished user experience
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure functionality works across all device sizes

## Components and Interfaces

### Enhanced Landing Page Component
```typescript
interface LandingPageState {
  showNavigation: boolean;
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  mounted: boolean;
}

interface NavigationProps {
  isVisible: boolean;
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  onNavigate?: (section: string) => void;
}
```

### Navigation Bar Component
- **Position**: Appears below the existing content, integrated seamlessly
- **Items**: Three navigation links - Projects, Notes, Photos
- **Styling**: Matches existing typography and color scheme
- **Animation**: Slide-in/fade-in effect when toggled
- **Responsive**: Horizontal layout on desktop, potentially stacked on mobile

### "See My Notes" Text Element
- **Placement**: Added after the existing social links section
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing link styling (underline on hover)
- **Interaction**: Click handler to toggle navigation visibility
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and click animation

## Data Models

### Navigation Items
```typescript
interface NavigationItem {
  label: string;
  href: string;
  description?: string;
}

const navigationItems: NavigationItem[] = [
  { label: 'projects', href: '/projects' },
  { label: 'notes', href: '/notes' },
  { label: 'photos', href: '/photos' }
];
```

### Component State
```typescript
interface AppState {
  navigationVisible: boolean;
  currentTheme: 'light' | 'dark';
  isClient: boolean;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Rendering
- Handle hydration mismatches for theme state
- Graceful fallback if localStorage is unavailable
- Loading states during theme initialization

### Navigation Errors
- Handle missing routes gracefully
- Provide fallback navigation if JavaScript fails
- Maintain accessibility with proper ARIA labels

### Theme Consistency
- Ensure navigation bar respects current theme
- Handle theme changes while navigation is visible
- Maintain theme persistence across navigation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test navigation toggle functionality
- Verify theme consistency across components
- Test responsive behavior at different breakpoints
- Validate accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Integration Tests
- Test navigation between different sections
- Verify theme persistence across page transitions
- Test interaction with existing functionality (theme toggle, external links)

### Visual Regression Tests
- Ensure existing layout remains unchanged
- Verify navigation animations work smoothly
- Test dark/light theme variations
- Validate responsive design across devices

### User Experience Tests
- Test click/tap interactions on different devices
- Verify smooth animations and transitions
- Ensure navigation is discoverable and intuitive
- Test keyboard navigation and accessibility

## Implementation Details

### CSS Transitions
- Use CSS transforms for smooth slide/fade animations
- Maintain 60fps performance during transitions
- Respect user's motion preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)

### Responsive Considerations
- Navigation bar adapts to screen size
- Touch-friendly targets on mobile devices
- Proper spacing and typography scaling

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for navigation elements
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management during navigation toggle

### Performance
- Lazy load navigation component if needed
- Minimize bundle size impact
- Optimize animations for smooth performance
- Maintain existing page load performance
